SQA Engineer Preparation Roadmap (December 2025)
This is a step-by-step, sequential learning roadmap to prepare you for a Software Quality Assurance (SQA) Engineer role in 2025–2026. Follow the steps one after another. Complete both theory and hands-on practice before moving to the next step.
Total estimated time: 8–14 months (10–20 hours/week)
Key focus in 2025: Automation with modern tools (Playwright preferred), API testing, CI/CD integration, and basic AI/cloud awareness.
1. Software Testing Fundamentals (2–3 weeks)

Testing principles (ISTQB 7 principles)
Verification vs Validation
Functional vs Non-functional testing
Defect clustering, Pesticide paradox
Intro to AI-assisted testing
Practice: Memorize ISTQB Foundation glossary terms; self-quiz daily.

2. SDLC, STLC & Methodologies (2 weeks)

Waterfall, Agile, Scrum, Kanban
DevOps and CI/CD overview
Shift-Left testing
STLC phases in detail
Practice: Draw and explain SDLC/STLC diagrams; describe QA role in a Scrum sprint.

3. Test Case Design Techniques (3 weeks)

Equivalence Partitioning
Boundary Value Analysis
Decision Table Testing
State Transition Testing
Error Guessing
Practice: Write 50+ test cases for common scenarios (login, registration, checkout).

4. Defect Management (1–2 weeks)

Bug life cycle
Severity vs Priority
Professional bug report writing
Jira basics (create projects, log bugs)
Practice: Find and log 15 real bugs from public websites.

5. Essential Tools Basics (2 weeks)

Git (clone, commit, branch, pull request)
Browser DevTools (Elements, Network, Console)
Postman (simple GET/POST requests)
Practice: Clone a repo, inspect elements on sites, test public APIs.

6. Manual Testing Mastery (4 weeks)

Smoke, Sanity, Regression, Retesting
Exploratory testing (charter-based)
UI/UX checklist
Cross-browser & basic accessibility testing
Practice: Perform full manual testing on 5–10 real websites/apps and document findings.

7. SQL for QA Engineers (3 weeks)

SELECT, WHERE, JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
Aggregates, GROUP BY, HAVING
Subqueries and data validation scenarios
Practice: Solve 100+ queries on LeetCode, HackerRank, or SQLZoo.

8. API Testing (3 weeks)

REST vs SOAP
HTTP methods & status codes
JSON/XML structure
Authentication (Basic, Bearer, API keys)
Postman advanced (variables, environments, tests/scripts)
Practice: Test public APIs (reqres.in, jsonplaceholder, dummy.restapiexample).

9. Programming Fundamentals (4 weeks)

Choose one language: Python (recommended for beginners & AI tools) or JavaScript/TypeScript
Variables, data types, loops, conditionals, functions, basic OOP
Practice: Solve 50+ logic-based coding problems (no complex algorithms needed).

10. Web Automation – Core (5–6 weeks)

Primary tool (2025 trend): Playwright (faster, more reliable)
Setup, locators, actions (click, fill, select)
Waits, handling alerts/frames/popups

Fallback: Cypress or Selenium (if job postings specifically ask)
Practice: Automate 30+ scenarios on demo sites (saucedemo.com, demoqa.com, the-internet.herokuapp).

11. Testing Frameworks & Reporting (3 weeks)

Playwright Test / pytest (Python) or Jest (JS)
Parallel execution, parameterization/data-driven testing
Reporting (Allure, built-in HTML reports)
Practice: Organize scripts into structured framework with reports.

12. Advanced Automation Concepts (4 weeks)

Page Object Model (POM) / Page Objects
BDD with Cucumber (Gherkin) or Behave
Configuration files, logging
Build tools (npm/playwright or Maven if Java)
Intro to self-healing tests (Applitools or similar free tools)
Practice: Build a complete end-to-end framework for a sample application.

13. Mobile & Cross-Platform Testing (3 weeks)

Cloud tools: BrowserStack, Sauce Labs, LambdaTest (free trials)
Appium basics (optional)
Testing responsive web & native apps
Practice: Run your Playwright/Cypress tests on mobile viewports or cloud devices.

14. Performance & Security Basics (3 weeks)

JMeter: Thread groups, samplers, listeners (basic load test)
OWASP ZAP: Quick scan for vulnerabilities
Practice: Run simple load & security scans on demo sites.

15. CI/CD & DevOps for QA (2–3 weeks)

GitHub Actions (recommended) or Jenkins basics
Trigger automation suite on push/commit
Docker basics (run tests in containers)
Practice: Set up a simple pipeline that runs your test suite.

16. Emerging Trends (2–4 weeks, ongoing)

AI-powered testing tools (Mabl, Testim, Functionize – try free tiers)
Cloud testing concepts (AWS Device Farm, Azure)
Test data management basics
Practice: Experiment with one AI testing tool on a small project.

17. Certifications, Portfolio & Job Preparation (Ongoing)

Highly recommended: ISTQB Foundation Level (v4.0 – latest syllabus)
Optional advanced: ISTQB Test Automation Engineer
Portfolio: Clean GitHub repo with:
Full automation framework
README with setup instructions
Sample bug reports
Test plans/cases

Resume: Highlight tools (Playwright, Postman, Jira, Git, SQL)
Interview Prep:
Common scenario questions
Live coding (locators, basic scripts)
Behavioral (STAR method)

Practice: Daily mock interviews (Pramp, Interviewing.io), apply to junior QA roles.

Final Tips

70% practice, 30% theory – hands-on experience is what gets you hired.
Prioritize Playwright (fastest growing tool in 2025 job postings).
Track progress in a notebook or Notion/Trello.
Join communities: Ministry of Testing, Reddit r/QualityAssurance, LinkedIn QA groups.
